            My name is Toshie, and I’m a dedicated software engineering student with a strong passion for coding and 
            problem-solving. I’m always eager to learn new programming languages and techniques, and I find great 
            satisfaction in tackling complex challenges and finding efficient solutions. This love for problem-solving 
            extends to various areas of my life, from academic projects to personal coding endeavors. Outside of school 
            and programming, I also enjoy exploring the world of Pokémon, which sparks my creativity and curiosity.
             I find the intricate strategies and designs within the Pokémon universe fascinating. Additionally, 
             I express my creativity through baking, particularly crafting delicious desserts that bring joy to those
              around me. Whether it’s coding a new app, capturing a rare Pokémon, or perfecting a new cake recipe, 
              I always strive to combine my technical skills with my creative passions in everything I do.
